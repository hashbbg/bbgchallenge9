# [BBGChallenge9](http://hashbbg.github.com/bbgchallenge9)

A new edition of [#bbg](http://hashbbg.com)'s twelve hour HTML5 game making competition has arrived !
This will allow you to prove to all (including yourself) that you can create a playable game in only twelve hours.

#### Dates!

The challenge starts on 15th october, 11:59pm GMT, and finishes 15th November, 11:59pm GMT.

#### Theme:

The theme for the contest is:

***Royal Shark Championship***

Picked randomly using [videogamena.me](http://videogamena.me/).

## Rules

### team work

Entries can be presented by teams or individuals.

#### Submission

Fork this repo, create a folder for your entry, then pull request us when you're done.

#### Content restriction

* Use only content you have a legal right to.
* There's no problem with serious topics, but any explicit content should give the viewer some warning.  Any game with more serious content than [PG13](http://www.mpaa.org/ratings/what-each-rating-means) must show an up-front warning. 

#### Time restriction

Make sure you mark on your submission (preferably somewhere in the README or in the game itself) the number of hours spent to create it. 

You have to do all of the actual coding, music making and art making on the game itself within the 12 hours.  Feel free to do research/conceptual stuff outside that, like:

* Thinking/conceptualising
* Drafting game design
* Looking for tools/art/music

#### Libs/tools

Use any lib or tool you like.  It's all fair game ;)

#### Platform

It has to run in a browser! Feel free to specify *which* browser, but remember; if you're too specific, fewer people may end up playing it.
